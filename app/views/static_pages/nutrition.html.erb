	Our non-traditional management systems provide our berries maximum sunshine.  Fruit exposed to the sun contain higher sugar levels (brix), which in turn provides greater nutrient values that include today's sought after antioxidants.

	What is Brix?
</p>
<p class="cn">
	什么是Brix?(含糖指数)
</p>
<p>
	Brix directly relates to the total soluble solids content (SSC) of a the fruit which is determined by the index of refraction. This is measured using a refractometer, and is referred to as the degrees Brix.
</p>
<p class="cn">
	Birx指数直接涉及可溶性总固体（SSC）含量。它利用折射计测定，被称为Brix指数。
</p>

<p>
	The degrees Brix measurement represents all of the dissolved solids in the sample which includes soluble minerals, carbohydrates (sugars and starches) and other soluble chemicals such as amino acids, enzymes, and so on. 
</p>
<p class="cn">
	Brix指数代表了样本中所有的可溶性物质，其中包括了可溶性矿物质，碳水化合物（糖和淀粉），以及其他可溶性的化学物质，例如氨基酸，酶等等。
</p>
<p>
	The higher the Brix, the better the quality and the more nutritionally dense the produce. Nutrient Dense Foods have very high levels of vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants, and trace minerals. Major minerals are abundantly supplied as are trace elements such as selenium, chromium, iodine, and cobalt.  As a result they have the greatest impact on improving health and providing nutrition against disease.
</p>
<p class="cn">
	Brix指数越高，说明奇异果品质越好，营养越丰富。营养丰富的食物含有非常高的维生素，碳水化合物，矿物质，酶，抗氧化成分，以及微量矿物质。奇异果含有丰富的主要矿物质元素，同时还含有丰富的微量元素，比如硒，铬，碘和钴。因此它们对提高身体健康，对抗疾病有很大的影响。

	Some of the healthful benefits KiwiBerries include
</h3>

<h4>
	Antioxidants:
</h4>
<ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		Nature's immune- boosting defense against colds and flu
	</li>
	<li>
		Cleanses the body of impurities, and helps combat the effects of stress and aging
	</li>
	<li>
		Helps repair the body and enhance cell growth
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>

</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		A good source - extremely hard to find in low-fat food sources
	</li>
	<li>
		Helps lower high cholesterol and reduces narrowing of the arteries
	</li>

</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Shortage in the American diet - especially in women using oral contraceptives, those who are pregnant or breast feeding as well as some children and older adults.
	</li>
	<li>
		A serving of kiwi has some 4% of USRDA of B6 making it one of the few foods rich in this vitamin
	</li>
	<li>
		Important to the immune system to fight disease
	</li>
	<li>
		Helps maintain a normal blood sugar level

Cholesterol and Fat:

-Contains no cholesterol and virtually no fat only about 1 gram per serving from the tiny black seeds.

- Helps fight heart disease and high cholesterol

- Great for those on weight-loss programs

 

Minerals:

Potassium - Higher per ounce than bananas

- A single serving outranks bananas as the top low-sodium, high-potassium fruit

- Critical to maintaining the body's fluid and electrolyte balance

- Assists in the reduction of hypertension and high blood pressure

Magnesium

- Important for bone formation, heart rhythm regulation, muscle relaxation, and nerve function

- Activates enzymes that metabolize food components to form protein and release energy

Manganese

- An essential to the enzymes involved in our use of protein and food energy, and also in the marketing of body chemicals needed to protect both our respiratory and digestive tracts.

Copper - For Kids

- Vital for infant growth, bone strength, brain development, and building immunity

- A mineral involved in making red blood cells and needed for normal bone formation.

Calcium

- Essential for normal growth and maintenance of bones and teeth

- Kiwi Berries are a source of calcium without the additional fat of dairy products

Iron

- Needed for oxygen-based metabolism

- Small amounts can be meaningful for those with problems of iron-deficiency anemia

Phosphorus

- A component of DNA and RNA and an essential element for all living cells

Selenium

- An essential trace element

- May help prevent cancer by acting as an antioxidant or by enhancing immune activity

Chromium

- A key factor both in regulating the heartbeat and the body's use of carbohydrates, like sugars and starches, which are our bodies main source of energy

Zinc - For Men

- Important for young boys and men - an ingredient needed to make the hormone testosterone

- Necessary for healthy hair, nails, eyes, and skin

Sodium

- Kiwi is low in sodium and contains no cholesterol and virtually no fat only about 1 gram per serving from the tiny black seeds.

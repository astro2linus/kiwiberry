	<blockquote>I discovered these gems at Wegmans last season and instantly became obsessed.  I kept going back until they were gone. Seriously, Awesome Fruit - there is nothing like it. I'm so excited that the season is almost upon us.  It's the first time I can remember looking forward to the end of summer - this fruit is the sole reason. If you haven't gotten the idea, I love your product.  Simply Divine!

	We guarantee the sweetest, best tasting, most nutritious kiwi !

 
Our Passion Poppers and Aloha Annas  ripen and blush in the sun, and are hand picked at the peak of maturity which yields berries with higher nutritional value, and enhanced flavors.  We harvest and pack our fruit to ripen uniformly providing you with a consistent product.

 
Our Kiwi Berries are organically grown so they are safe for you to eat.  They are not  sprayed with cancer causing organophosphates or picked too early and ripened with ethylene.

 
This fruit is sensational for out-of-hand eating when they turn a darker green and are slightly wrinkled. Their smooth skin makes them easy to eat anywhere - they're a perfect addition to a lunch box for a nutritious, mid-day energy boost.  They are versatile in culinary creations too - we've made sauces for entrees, salad dressings, marinades, desserts, and drinks. 

They will satisfy anyone with a discriminating palate for the very finest, best-tasting organic fruit.

	What You will find in our package...

 
One order consists of (12) six ounce clamshells (as seen above) of Passion Poppers or Aloha Annas.  Our clamshells are packed to the brim and are over weight which means that you will be receiving about 5 lbs. of fruit, approximately 1/2 lb. of Kiwi Berries free.
By purchasing through our Kiwi Berry Direct shipping program, we are able to offer our organic Kiwi Berries to you for less than the suggested retail pricing in stores.

	Our "signature" fruit unequaled in taste and nutrition, has blended flavors of super sweet kiwi and exotic melon with a cotton candy finish.  These berries have the highest sugar levels (Brix),  from 24 to 28, yet a low glycemic index, and medium/low acid.  This variety is only available from us, is the first harvested, and should be available to ship in mid September.

 

A flavorful combination of kiwi, pineapple, and a slight hint of mint.  These berries reach a sugar level (Brix) up to 22 thanks to our custom trellis system that provides them with lots of sunshine and blush.  This variety is  harvested  after the Passion Poppers and should be available to ship the latter part of Sept.
